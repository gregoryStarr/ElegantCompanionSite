Project Goal: Build an elegant, responsive website for a professional VIP companion. The site should have a high-end, sophisticated feel, with a user-friendly navigation structure and a design that emphasizes luxurious, tasteful aesthetics.

Website Specifications:
Landing Page

A clean and minimalistic layout featuring a prominent, high-quality image of the VIP companion on the left.
A sidebar on the right with the site's logo ("Charlotte Emerson" with "New York VIP Companion" in smaller text below), along with navigation links for different sections: Welcome, Introduction, Visuals I-IV, Rates, Answers, Wishlist, Bookings, Tours.
Keep the color palette neutral with black, white, and muted tones to keep focus on the visuals and text.
Image Gallery (Visuals I-IV)

Implement multiple image gallery pages labeled "Visuals I," "Visuals II," etc.
Each page should use a lightbox gallery format, where clicking on an image opens it in a larger view.
Ensure smooth transitions and high-resolution support for all images.
Add subtle navigation arrows or dots to guide the user through different visual sections.
Rates Page

A section detailing rates for various services, organized in a list format.
Each rate entry should include the title of the service (e.g., "Introduction," "Interlude," etc.), duration, and cost. Use a sophisticated font and layout to make it visually appealing.
Include any special notes or terms beneath the list, such as requirements for longer dates or additional charges.
Design this section to maintain the luxury aesthetic, possibly using a dark background with golden or white text to highlight the information.
Bookings Page

Include a small introduction at the top explaining the booking process and contact options.
Provide an email link (e.g., "VipCharlotte@Proton.me") and a link to the Twitter handle ("@vip_charlotte1").
Add a button labeled "Launch Booking Form" that opens a form where clients can request appointments.
Include a mandatory screening statement that requires new clients to submit ID or references for verification.
Styling & UX Details

Font and Color: Choose elegant, serif fonts for titles and clean, sans-serif fonts for body text. Stick with a monochrome palette accented by occasional colors from the companion’s branding or clothing in images (e.g., deep reds or greens).
Responsive Design: Ensure the website looks impeccable on both desktop and mobile devices, adjusting the image grid and sidebar layout as needed.
Animations: Add subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins or hover effects) to enhance the luxurious feel without overwhelming the user.
Footer: Simple footer with copyright information, year (e.g., "© Charlotte Emerson 2024"), and a credit to the web designer ("Website by Paramour Designs").
SEO & Accessibility

Optimize images with alt tags describing each visual respectfully and generally.
Ensure color contrast for readability and add ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility.
Expected Deliverables:

A fully functional, visually stunning website with the sections outlined above.
All pages and features should be implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a suitable framework as needed).
Files and folders organized for easy maintenance, with descriptive comments in the code.
