            <h3>How do you ensure mutual comfort in our initial meeting?</h3>
            <p>To cultivate an environment of trust and refinement, I maintain a careful verification process for new acquaintances. This typically includes professional references or verifiable business credentials. This discrete approach ensures our time together begins with mutual understanding and respect.</p>

            <h3>What is your philosophy on scheduling encounters?</h3>
            <p>To maintain the exceptional quality of each experience, I prefer to arrange meetings with at least 48 hours' notice. For extended engagements or special occasions, additional preparation time allows me to craft truly bespoke experiences tailored to your preferences.</p>
